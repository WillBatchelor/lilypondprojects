# The Various Artists

Due to the way Lilypond is structured I was unable to list the original artists credited for each piece. Therefore, I will do so here in this README file. Two things to keep in mind:

	1. The original material belongs to the respective artists. What you see is my arrangement of the original source material
	2. The artists will go in order they are featured in the pdf.

With or Without You - U2

Somewhere Only We Know - Lily Allan

Here Comes the Sun - The Beatles

Hoppípolla - Sigur Rós

Salted Wounds - Sia

Naked As We Came - Iron & Wine

You've Got the Love - Florence + The Machine
